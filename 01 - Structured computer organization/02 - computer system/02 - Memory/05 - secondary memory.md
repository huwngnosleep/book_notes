# Magnetic Disk

A disk can contain 1 to 12 plate, which can be read and write separately

each rotation is called **track**, each track is divided into **sectors**, each sector contains fixed 512 data bytes

each disk has a moveable arm to read and write, main cost of disk is about **seeking**, which is too large on comparing to data transfer time
